Set in the near future, Geostorm begins with Earth experiencing a series of catastrophic natural disasters. In response, an international coalition creates “Dutch Boy,” a network of satellites designed to control the climate and prevent such disasters. However, when the system starts to malfunction, causing deadly weather events, Jake Lawson is called back to fix the problem. Alongside his estranged brother Max (Jim Sturgess), Jake uncovers a conspiracy that threatens to unleash a “geostorm”—a chain reaction of extreme weather that could wipe out millions</p>
